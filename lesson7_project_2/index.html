    	<h1>The Effect of Feminist Culture on Pop Music</h1>
    	<h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
     <p> Music is a universal way we, as a society communicate. It has the ability to break language barriers, convey strong messages, and all the while serve as an art form. Pop is a relatively new genre, and has maintained popularity for the entirety of its existence. Pop music can be defined as music with a vocal, lyrical component, and an up-beat rhythym. Generally speaking, pop music is popular within the younger population, ranging from young children up to thirty-something year olds. That being said, many older people enjoy this genre as well, keeping its popularity steady as it consistenly dominates the top charts.</p>
    <p>Due to pop music's consistent popularity, many artists choose to use this as a medium to make a political, or social statement. Looking specifically at artists in the United States, there has been a massive wave of politically driven music within the Trump Presidency. One movment that has been particularly influential on the pop music industry is the feminist movement. The feminist movement generally has strong values of empowerment among women, independence, and self love. While this movement is most definitely not anything new, its rise in popularity has changed the subject topic of many songs.</p>
    <p>One artist in particular has made a very evident change in her musical subject matter. Ariana Grande is an American pop singer, with her general audience being teenage girls to young women. Taking this into account, it is no surprise that her subject matter tends to focus on boys and relationship drama. Her musical style is primariy pop, with hints of r&b and rap throughout her discography. </p>
    <p>On her first album, <em>Yours Truly</em>, Grande  sings about her current relationship. Through the album title as well as song titles, she clearly conveys her emotions towards her current partner. Following her album history, as well as her relational past, Ariana's albums focus on the ups and downs; with songs such as <em>The Way</em> describing her good times, and <em>Problem</em> describing her being better off without her man.</p>
    
      <p> Ariana Grande's newest album, <em>Thank U, Next</em> has been rejoiced by many fans as a breakthrough in feminist culturre in music, with nearly every track on the album focusing around the idea of self-love. The headlining song, and namesake for the album, <em>Thank U, Next</em> explains how every one of her past relationships has shaped her in a positive way, and that she is grateful but ready to move on.</p>
